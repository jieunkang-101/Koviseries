### ✤ Preview

## 2. Scope

### ✤ Use Case
<details>
<summary>Expand Use Case</summary>
The users of this app will be those who are interested in Korean movies and TV shows but are uncomfortable to search with a specific query. Users don’t need to search using filters on existing massive movie applications. I think there are more and more people interested in Korean movies and TV shows these days, but there is not enough app to provide information about them. This application will be focused on that need.

The product will be able to display movies and TV shows that are now playing, popular, upcoming, top-rated, and show the details of each movie or TV show.

The product will offer search functionality.

(Users will be able to sign-up, login, and sign-out. Users can mark as a favorite movie or TV show and see them on their favorite list.)
